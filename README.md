I created this project to automate report creation that I'm responsible during my work.
It has multiple options, such as reading from file (with deleting it from drive after), comparing info, hightligting cells that are needed to be filled etc.

Later I'll provide Excel report that goes with that with some test data alongside .xlam (VBA macros) file.

It has very specific parths that are needed to be changed in customUI file to be working correctly.
