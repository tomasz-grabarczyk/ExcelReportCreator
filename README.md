I created this project to (almost fully) automate report creation that I'm responsible during my work.
It has multiple options, such as reading from file (with deleting it from drive after), comparing info, hightligting cells that are needed to be filled etc.

Later I'll provide Excel report that goes with that with some test data and .xlam (VBA macros) file that has all of these macros built-in.

It has very specific parths that are needed to be changed in exportedUI file to be working correctly (and imported to Excel ribbon to work - exportedUI file creates new tab in ribbon after importing).

It isn't done by any means, constantly upgrading and optimizing it, as well as adding new functions when needed.
